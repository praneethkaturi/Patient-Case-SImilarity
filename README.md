## Patient-Case-Similarity
Smart India Hackathon grand fianlist
The goal of this project is to identify the similarity between given patients base on their demographics, lab-test values, prescription
notes, discharge summaries etc.

I have used two different approached in order to predict the similarity-
1. Use an autoencoder to get an enriched representation of the cleaned data and then pass it through another final autoencoder for     
   predictions
2. Use latent semantic indexing on the cleaned data.

The dataset is confidential as it contains seneitive medical data, Contact praneeth.katurui007@gmail.com regarding further queties.
